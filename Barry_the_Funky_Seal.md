# Barry, the Funky Seal

Now, enough of that nonsense! Let's talk about the fun stuff: Barry, our
extremely likeable namesake.

Barry, to be honest, a little bit on the slow side of things, but this is quiet
understandable as he lives on a planet, where seals just live forever. And ever.
While not being the sharpest knife in the drawer - some might say, he's more
like a spoon -, he sidesteps this limitation by a heart of warmth and limitless
love and patient curiosity towards everyone and everything around him.
Especially fish.

Barry likes to read a lot, mostly books that he came up with in his imagination.
But sometimes he reads books he finds lying around to spend time somes with
friends who signed up to one of Rip's travel agenciy's offerings.

## knitten

While Barry lives forever knitten dies and reborn one and half times per Planck
time, which is pretty fast. The infinite sadness over knitten's death and the
infinite joy over his best frind's rebirth kind of smooths out each other in
Barry's heart, so he got used to it Epochs ago.

knitten is officially the cutest white small fluffy arctic cat on the planet who
is the match maker there, a little cupid, who birngs lovers together in
sweet-sweet harmony. She also happens to be a bloody psychopath who tears these
lovers apart to recreate them as one in the match making process. Luckily she is
pretty quick so nobody feels a thing. Only Barry knows about this, but since it
doesn't bother anyone really, on the contraray coming together makes everybody
_more_ happy, he just looks the other way.

Sometimes knitten wears lipstick, at least that's what she says it is. Barry's
not so sure but loves knitten anyway.

## Victor

Victor is a quiet n-dimensional icecube who can function as a hyperdimensional
telescope for Barry. He doesn't mind either if the friends throw him around
during board games of epic proportions as a dice.

Victor likes sports in general, but simply manic about football. The only thing
he likes more is winning. He plays football alone, because that way he can
always win. It doesn't really bother anyone and everybody remembers when Victor
challenged the penguins for a match and forced everyone to try to beat them. Of
course the penguins won. knitten got a red card in the first nanosecond for
disintegrating a penguin. Victor was running around the pitch, shouting with
everybody all the time, shaming his friends and insulting the penguins. After
the match he melted and was blaming Barry for epochs for the outcome, who was
the goalie of course. Anyway, Barry likes waterpolo much better. In theory.

## Rip

The Reaper, or just Rip for his friends, wears a black hooded rope that shadows
it's face all the time and walks with a scythe all the time, which is kind of
strange. If it even has a face, we don't know. Anyway, everybody avoids Rip for
some reason. Surprisingly Rip is kind of bubbly despite all the loneliness,
probably for the succsess of the travel agency it runs, that specializes on one
way trips.

## Stella

Stella is all the starfish on the planet, and she is _beautiful_. She is the
most beautiful in starlight during the night. She reproduces by multiplication
so Stella _is_ all around and that makes the whole planet beautiful.

## Wily

Wily is an orca and he is a bike messenger. Since most orcas are named William,
one form or another, if you encounter a being named William, there's a very high
probability it's an orca. Anyway, Wily's thinking seems to revolve around the
concept of freedom: how important freedom is, how iportant the freedom of Wily
is and how proud Wili is of his freedom. At least he is so occupied with his own
freedom, that he doesn't bother trying to limit others'. It can get a bit
anoying anyway, because in Wily's interpretation freedom gives him the right to
change others. Now this can lead to friction if, as it happens, the party on the
other side of Wily's "freedom" doesn't want to change that much.

But Wily is good listener, you can share your heart's weights with him anytime,
if you don't mind the seemingly infinite monologe about how you should modify
your personality. Completely.

Barry sometimes comes up with imaginary hardships that he can share with Wily,
so he can listen to Wily's endless suggestions, advices and mandatory
recomendations, because the idea of changing his personality entertains him
infinitely. It just makes him giggle.

## mU

mU is a mostly white cow with large black spots. mU is _essentially_ Barry, just
happens to live on another planet. On that planet cows live casually forever. It
needless to say that mU is also pretty lazy. She's actually the same being, like
another cap of the same fungi living under the roots of the same forest.

## Welv

Welv is an arctic fox. If you ask her she will tell, she's interested in
metaphysics, but what she _really_ seems to be interested in is gossip. She
talks about others all the time, and to be honest not always the nicest things.
Luckliy everybody likes gossip just enogh to not being bothered.

## Shebang

Shebang is the entire universe in which Barry's planet located and happening in.
She is very nice and helps to everybody, until they behave like she wants them
to. Friction usually occurs when they're not. It's not that's she's angry or
something, it's more like she knows best how _she_ works. She constantly tries
to communicate, but everybody is living _inside_ her, and everybody is used to
communicate with beings from the _outside_.

## Dyllberd

Dyllberd is the husbend of Shebang and they're inseparable. Now, while Shebang
is uncomprehensibly huge, Dyllberd is uncomprehensibly small. Whyle Shebang is
composed of everything - at least in that universe -, everything is composed of
Dyllberd. Barry thinks he kind of understands this, or at least _feels_ it.
Dyllberd wears silly hats and _always_ in the process of walking out a door.
This makes it a bit cumbersome to engage in longer conversations with him.

## Nope
